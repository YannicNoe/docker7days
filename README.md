# steamcmd

A docker container for Steam based game servers via [SteamCMD](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD).

## Overview

Includes steamcmd and its dependencies.  Just run `$STEAMCMD_DIR/steamcmd.sh` in your own Dockerfile or via `docker run` or `docker exec`, etc.

## Disclaimer

The Dockerfile is originally from [Zobees](https://github.com/zobees/docker-steamcmd), but I wanted to have the latest Ubuntu as base.
